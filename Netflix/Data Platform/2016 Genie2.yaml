solutions:
   - ETL
   - Hadoop2
   - Parquet
   - Hive
   - Pig
   - Genie
   - Presto
   - Spark
   - Inviso
   - S3
   - Sqoop

hosting:
   - AWS

metrics:
   # source says "several hundred jobs"
   max-concurrent-jobs: 1000 


design-goals:
   - Generic data model to run jobs on multi-tenant distributed clusters
   - Flexible cluster and command selection algorithm for running a job
   - Improved APIs

limitations:
   # source is another blog https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/evolving-the-netflix-data-platform-with-genie-3-598021604dda
   - infrastructure jobs run on worker nodes -> redundant DB cleanups
   - no security support
   - no leadership election
   - rigid job types, no pluggable other task types
